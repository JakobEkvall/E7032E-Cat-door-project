  - Matilda and Anders will have a meeting Monday 4/9 to plan the project and try to find tasks for everyone, structure the work a bit more. 
- Division of roles and responsibilities. 
  - Project managers: Matilda (responsible for software LP1, hardware LP2) and Anders (responsible for hardware LP1 and software LP2)
  - Software engineer: Nebez
  - Hardware engineers: Agnes, Arvid, and Jakob
- Discussions
  - Using a different antenna? Is one side(outside, inside) more prone to malfunction? Confusion as to why the antenna can't pick up signals 
    from any direction since it's wrapped around the cat flap. 
  - Could we make a longer tunnel? Could work, but not something Jan would like. 
  - Discussions regarding hub/WiFi/server. Making sure it's low power, and information stays somewhat private. Sharing data locally and 
    keeping the device secure even if it's connected to the internet. 
  - We still have a lot to read about and learn regarding the cat flap, before we feel comfortable making decisions. 

- Next meeting 
  Tuesday, 5/9, 10:0
