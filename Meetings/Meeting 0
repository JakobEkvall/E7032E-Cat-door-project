Our initial meeting was mostly spent discussing our first week of the project. We realized quite quickly we don't have all the 
information/knowledge we need to make smart decisions, so our first tasks will be research. We need to learn about the different ISO's, the cat door, 
and the antenna. 

Matilda will set up a git and Agnes will create a template for the report. 

Next meeting is set for Thursday, 31/8, 15:00, in Bibl-12.
