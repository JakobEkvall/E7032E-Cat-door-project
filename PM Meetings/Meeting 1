Agenda: 
- GANTT chart
  We fixed the GANTT-chart
- Division of tasks  
  - We need to divide tasks among our team memebers. 
    - Software team has to figure out what kind of signals is being sent, and how to receive/use them. 
      This will be the first task, to ensure the software team can work in parallel with the hardware team. 
    - Hardware team: (Start with two working on antenna & IC, one working on IR-sensors (then power management or EMC))
      - Agnes: 
      - Jakob: 
      - Arvid: 

Things to do (hardware): 
- Build the cat flap completely from scratch. 
- Get low-frequncy signals, find IC for that, send data with microcontroller. Pick something with compability for everything, WiFi embedded? 
- Make antenna. 
- IR-sensors (how to they work?)
- PCB-design.
- Tests
- Power supply (keep it low power, rätt spänning. Notis vid lite batteri?) 
- Control motor. 
- Buttons (vilka behöver man? Vilka vill vi ha?)

Lol
- När IR-sensorer går igång, så öppnas luckan lite, så katten tror att luckan öppnas och går in mer, så sticker den in huvudet lite mer.
